                focus on Web Design and UX. He has learned the basics of building a website using html

                designer one day. His passion for technology started from a very young age, and his 
                desire to create a digital footprint has always motivated him to learn more about the 
                internet and the technologies that have been developed by it. Taking MI 349 Web Design
                and Developement was a major stepping stone because it allowed for hands on experince
