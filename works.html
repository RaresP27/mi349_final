            <h2>My First Website</h2>
            <p>My favorite website in MI 349 began as a blog about 2 topics of my choosing.
                For these topics I chose 2 passions of mine, traveling and Fragrances, and 
                I decided to make 2 articles about my favorite tourist sites in Romania and 
                some of my most favorite fragrances for the winter season. The website started
                off simple, but as more and more information began being added, it soon became
                a realistic looking blog that I could see myself updating regrularly. Using 
                and applying the concepts we learned about css and html in class like the flex
                box, an organized table, different ways to manipulate the page to appear how
                you want, etc. This is by far my most favorite website I've created and that
                I am most proud of. <br>
